# Tutorial Overview

The seL4 docsite provides a set of tutorials that introduce seL4 and show how to
develop systems on seL4. They are split into the following categories.

- The [Microkit tutorial] tutorial is an easy way to get started with seL4.
  The seL4 Microkit is a software development kit (SDK) for building systems
  with a statically described architecture on top of seL4. It provides simple,
  high-performance abstractions that manage much of the complexity of the seL4
  API.

- The [seL4 tutorials](setting-up.html) are for people keen to learn about the
  base mechanisms provided by the seL4 kernel. It explains the kernel API with
  short exercises that show basic usage examples.

- The [CAmkES tutorial](hello-camkes-0.html) introduces the CAmkES component platform
  on top of seL4. CAmkES provides abstractions for component on top of seL4 and
  communication glue code between them. It is designed for building
  high-assurance systems with a static software architecture. CAmkES is being
  superseded by Microkit and we recommend starting with the [Microkit tutorial]
  instead if you are starting a new project.

- The [Rust on seL4 tutorial] introduces the basic Rust crates for seL4 and
  shows how to get started writing root tasks and Microkit components in the
  Rust programming language.

- The [C library tutorials](libraries-1.html) provide walkthroughs and exercises for
  using the libraries provided in `seL4_libs`. These libraries were developed
  for rapidly prototyping systems on seL4. They are not meant for production
  code, but for experimenting with the seL4 API.
