# Rust: Supported Configurations

The Rust crates maintained by the seL4 Foundation support all configurations (that is, all platforms and combinations of CMake options) that are supported by the kernel itself, except those based on 32-bit x86. The Microkit-related crates support all Microkit configurations.

See the [Choosing a `--target` argument for `rustc`](./how-to-use.md#target-spec) section for information about how to target a particular configuration using `rustc`.
