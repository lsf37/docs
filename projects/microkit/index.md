# The seL4 Microkit

The seL4 Microkit is an operating system framework on top of seL4. It provides a
small set of simple abstractions that ease the design and implementation of
statically structured systems on seL4, leveraging the kernelâ€™s benefits of
security and performance.

The Microkit is distributed as an SDK that integrates with the build system of
your choice, significantly reducing the barrier to entry for new users of seL4.
