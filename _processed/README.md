# Target directory for generated files

This is target directory directory for generated/processed files based on data
or input taken from other repositories in `../_repos`.

- `tutes/` contains processed md files from the sel4-tutorials repository

- `microkit-tutorial/` contains processed md files from the microkit-tutorial

These files will then be included via Jekyll/Liquid tags elsewhere in the site.
