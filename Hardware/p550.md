# HiFive Premier P550

The HiFive Premier P550 is a RISC-V development platform from SiFive based
on the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC. It is a quad-core SoC using the SiFive P550
CPU.

Details and links to manuals can be found on the [SiFive product page]
(https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550).

The SoC technical reference manual can be found [here]
(https://github.com/eswincomputing/EIC7700X-SoC-Technical-Reference-Manual/releases).

The P550 arrives with the following boot process from the SPI flash:

1. Firmware starts
2. OpenSBI starts
3. U-Boot proper starts

From U-Boot proper you can then load and start an seL4 image, see below for details.

## Building the GCC toolchain

{% include risc-v.md %}

## Building seL4test

{% include sel4test.md %}

## Booting via microSD card

These instructions expect the microSD card to be paritioned with FAT.

The microSD card slot registers as device `1` in U-Boot so to see if the device
is recognised run:
```sh
mmc dev 1
# Check that the card info is expected
mmc info
# List partitions
mmc part
```

To load and run the image:
```sh
fatload mmc 1:<PARTITION> 0x90000000 sel4test-driver-image-riscv-p550
go 0x90000000
```

## Booting via TFTP

If you have setup a TFTP server, enter the following commands on the U-Boot console
to load an image via the network.

```sh
dhcp
tftpboot 0x90000000 <YOUR_TFTP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:sel4test-driver-image-riscv-p550
go 0x90000000
```
