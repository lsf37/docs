# Inforce

**Warning: seL4 support for this platform is unmaintained.  Using it would require fixing userlevel library support which is known to be broken.**

This page contains info on building seL4 for the
[Inforce IFC6410](http://www.inforcelive.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=53) development board, running a Qualcomm Krait processor that
is like an A15. Krait is a Qualcomm reimplementation of ARMv7A.

# Building for the Inforce IFC6410
 To use default build config, use
"inforce_" configurations.

To make a bootable image you will need the Android bootimg tool. On
Debian, do

```bash
apt-get install android-mkbootimg
```
Then when you have built your app, you can create a boot image with
these commands (substituting the name of your output file for
"sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064"):


```bash
> ramdisk
objcopy -O binary sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064 sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064.bin
mkbootimg --kernel sel4test-driver-image-arm-apq8064.bin --ramdisk ramdisk --base "0x82000000" --output boot.img
```
## Serial Console
The serial port on the Inforce is at RS232 voltage levels. Connect to a
normal serial port, then use minicom or screen to talk to it, at 115200
baud, no parity, eight bits.

# Booting seL4
 Force the board to boot into Fastboot mode by shorting
pins 26 and 30 on the large header â€” see
[This blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150526213626/http://mydragonboard.org/2013/forcing-ifc6410-into-fastboot) for details.

You will see something like this on the serial port:
```
Android Bootloader - UART_DM Initialized!!!
[0] welcome to lk

[10] platform_init()
[10] target_init()
[130] USB init ept @ 0x88f4e000
[170] fastboot_init()
[170] udc_start()
[300] -- reset --
[300] -- portchange --
[470] fastboot: processing commands
```
You can then do:

```
fastboot boot boot.img
```
and should then see the output from your
app.

# CAVEATS
 The timer driver is not complete, which means that two of
the tests in seL4test will fail.
