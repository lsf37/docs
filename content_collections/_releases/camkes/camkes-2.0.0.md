# CAmkES 2.0.0 Release Notes


The new release updates CAmkES to be compatible with seL4 version 2.0.0.
It also marks the transition to more frequent and regular releases, as
well as switching our release process to semantic versioning, so it's
easy to tell which CAmkES releases are source-compatible, or will
require updates to user-level code, and also with which seL4 versions
they will be compatible.
