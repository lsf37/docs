# seL4 Version 10.0.0 Release
 Announcing the release of `seL4 10.0.0` with the following changes:

10.0.0 2018-05-28: BREAKING

- Final version of the kernel  which supports integration with Kbuild based projects
- Future versions, including this one, provide a CMake based build system

For more information see [Building](../../projects/buildsystem/).

## Changes

 * x86 IO ports now have an explicit IOPortControl capability to gate their creation. IOPort capabilities  may now only
   be created through the IOPortControl capability that is passed to the rootserver. Additionally IOPort capabilities
   may not be derived to have smaller ranges and the IOPortControl will not issue overlapping IOPorts
 * 32-bit support added for the initial prototype RISC-V architecture port

## Upgrade Notes

 * A rootserver must now create IOPort capabilities from the provided IOPortControl capability. As IOPorts can not
   have their ranges further restricted after creation it must create capabilities with the final desired granularity,
   remembering that since ranges cannot overlap you cannot issue a larger and smaller range that have any IO ports
   in common.
