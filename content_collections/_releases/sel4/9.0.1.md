# seL4 Version 9.0.1 Release
 Announcing the release of `seL4 9.0.1` with the following changes:

9.0.1 2018-04-18: BINARY COMPATIBLE

## Changes
 * On 64-bit architectures, the `label` field of `seL4_MessageInfo` is now 52 bits wide. User-level programs
   which use any of the following functions may break, if the program relies on these functions to mask the
   `label` field to the previous width of 20 bits. For more detail, see our
   [explanation on the seL4 mailing list](https://sel4.systems/pipermail/devel/2018-April/001934.html).
     - `seL4_MessageInfo_new`
     - `seL4_MessageInfo_get_label`
     - `seL4_MessageInfo_set_label`
 * Initial prototype RISC-V architecture port. This port currently only supports running in 64-bit mode without FPU or
   or multicore support on the Spike simulation platform. There is *no verification* for this platform.
