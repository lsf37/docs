# Introducing seL4 5.2.0
 Announcing the release of `seL4 5.2.0`
with the following changes:

Below are the changes to libsel4:

- Add `seL4_FastMessageRegisters`: Exposes number of registers used
        in IPC for more optimised user-level IPC stubs.
- Additional kernel entry types `VMExit` and `VCPUFault` added for
        benchmarking kernel entries.

x86 specific changes:

- multiboot memory map information passed to user-level through
        bootinfo extended regions
- Expose more seL4 constants

# Upgrade notes


- This release potentially breaks ABI with the earlier versions if
      using benchmarking kernel configurations.
