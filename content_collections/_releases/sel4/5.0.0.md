# Introducing seL4 5.0.0
 Announcing the release of `seL4 5.0.0`
with the following changes:

Below are the changes to the seL4 ABI and API:

## Generic changes:

- Add missing case to `seL4_getFault` (`seL4_Fault_DebugException`)
- Explicitly pack bootinfo data structures
- Modify `FinalizeLog` syscall - Now returns a number of entries in the log
- Extend bootinfo to support potentially arbitrary additional structures
- Deprecate bootinfo management in libsel4 - a replacement, `platsupport_get_bootinfo` can be found in `libsel4platsupport`

## x86 specific changes:

- Pass VBE information from multiboot through bootinfo
- Remove PAE support

## x86-64 specific changes:

- VT-x related cap and object definitions added
- seL4_VMEnter syscall added

## ARM specific changes:

- ARM-HYP: VCPU interface for manipulating banked registers added
- plat: added nvidia tx1 support
- ARM-HYP: Add support for save/restore of debug registers
- Add aarch64 implementation

# Upgrade notes

      with the earlier versions.
