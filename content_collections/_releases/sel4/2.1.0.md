# seL4 2.1.0 Release Notes
## New Features

- ability to generate libsel4 system calls without inlining them
- new kernel debugging feature added, which allows developers to
      call debug_printKernelEntryReason anywhere in the kernel which
      will output the entry reason and relevant arguments.

## Implementation improvements


- Some duplication between kernel and libsel4 removed.
- Many changes refactoring the x86 code base in preparation for the
      upcoming x86_64 platform port.

## API Additions


- `seL4_MappingFailedLookupLevel()` - get the page table level a
      frame mapping failed at. This will always return 2 (second level
      page table) for currently supported 32 bit platforms.
- `seL4_NumInitialCaps` constant added to `bootinfo.h` to track the
      first free slot in the initial task's cspace.

## Upgrade notes


Source compatible, some API additions.
